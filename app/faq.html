      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>It’s a simple tool to keep an eye on your most frequently used bike share stations. With a glance, you can tell whether your origin has enough bikes and your destination has enough docks. I made it for me, but you can use it, too.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>There are already quite a few apps that show you a map of nearby stations. I find them a bit fiddly. For the most part, I already know where the closest stations are—especially for the trips I take often. I just want to know if there are available bikes or docks. This lets me create a list that I can check quickly as I head out the door.</p>

      <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
      <p>Add stations. Click on a station to change its color—I use this to group stations by general location. Drag a station by its name to reorder. Click the “×” to delete a station.</p>

      <h3>Does it sync somewhere?</h3>
      <p>Your stations are saved to local storage. Your browser will remember your stations, but they won’t be synced to other browsers. You can also click the star, which links to a snapshot of the current list of stations that you can share/save/bookmark.
