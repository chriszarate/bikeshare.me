## What is this?

It’s a simple tool to keep an eye on your most frequently used bike share stations. With a glance, you can tell whether your origin has enough bikes and your destination has enough docks. I made it for me, but you can use it, too.

## Why?

There are already quite a few apps that show you a map of nearby stations. I find them a bit fiddly. For the most part, I already know where the closest stations are—especially for the trips I take often. I just want to know if there are available bikes or docks. This lets me create a list that I can check quickly as I head out the door.

## How do I use it?

Add stations. Click on a station to change its color—I use this to group stations by general location. Drag a station by its name to reorder. Click the “×” to delete a station.

Does it sync somewhere?

Your stations are saved to local storage. Your browser will remember your stations, but they won’t be synced to other browsers. You can also use the “snapshot” link to share/save/bookmark a list of stations. ([Here’s mine.][2])

## The damned thing doesn’t work!
